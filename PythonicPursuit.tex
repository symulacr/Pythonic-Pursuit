\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Pythonic Pursuit Game Loop}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State Initialize game variables (cellSize, cellNumber, snake, snakeDirection, snakeSpeed, snakeAlive, fruit)
    \While{snakeAlive}
        \State Read user input for controlling snake direction
        \State Move snake based on user input
        \State Check for collisions with walls, itself, or fruit
        \State Update game state and check if snake is alive
        \State Render the game (text-based representation)
        \State Pause for a short delay to control game speed
    \EndWhile
    \State End of game loop
  \end{algorithmic}
