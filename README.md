## Gameplay

The game starts with a snake placed in the middle of the screen. The player controls the snake's movement using arrow keys or specified controls. The objective is to guide the snake to eat fruits that randomly appear on the screen.

As the snake consumes fruits, it grows longer. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake's length increases. The player must avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body, which leads to game over.
